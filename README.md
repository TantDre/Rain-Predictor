# Rain-Predictor
Neural network that predicts if it will rain during the day using data from a weather station.    
  
Framework:  Tensorflow   
Input: Temperature, relative humidity och ambient pressure  
Output: Risk of rain  

# Performance v1.0
Neural network with 2 hidden layers each with 3 nodes. The network has been trained for 600 epochs using normalized data. The data consists of daily averages of each measurement.
